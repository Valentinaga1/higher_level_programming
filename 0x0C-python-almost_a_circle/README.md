- All your test files should be inside a folder tests
- You have to use the unittest module
- All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
- All your test files and folders should start with test_
- Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for models/base.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base.py
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
- You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base.py
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases so that you donâ€™t miss any edge case
